### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Natalia, and I am a Full Stack web developer.   
  
I have always been passionate about web development. I remember the first time my father showed me some basic HTML tags when I was in high school and how I spent hours coding my first web pages. My passion for coding did not end there. During the pandemic, I decided to use the time I got free from commuting to work and social activities to learn coding. After taking several self-paced coding courses on Udemy and Coursera, I enrolled in certificate programs in Back End with Python and Full-Stack Development (Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, University of Texas McCombs Business School Bootcamp) to advance my coding skills. I am passionate about brainstorming solutions for coding tasks and working on coding projects!     

* **Currently in progress:**


*I am currently working on the mental wellness website project designed in React JS, PHP with Mongo DB database. The project currently features fully functional Team pages on both client and admin sides. You can see the works-in-progress of this project <span>[here](https://github.com/nchernys/mental-wellness)</span>.  

*I continuing to work on the hotel reservation project that features a reservation form using the `<Calendar />` React component, hotel room description that includes a picture gallery with previews, and the mobile-first responsive design.
