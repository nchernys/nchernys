### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Natalia, and I am a Full Stack web developer.   
  
I have always been passionate about web development. I remember the first time my father showed me some basic HTML tags when I was in high school and how I spent hours coding my first web pages. My passion for coding did not end there. During the pandemic, I decided to use the time I got free from commuting to work and social activities to learn coding. After teaching myself HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I completed professional certificate programs in Back End with Python (Nucamp Coding Bootcamp) and Full-Stack Development (University of Texas McCombs School of Business) with the focus on the MERN (ReactJS, ExpressJS/NodeJS, MongoDB) stack and learning other technologies. After completing the bootcamps, I continued teaching myself new technologies, freelancing, and volunteering as a full-stack developer for nonprofit organizations. I am passionate about brainstorming solutions for programming tasks and working on developing application projects!
