### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Natalia, and Iâ€™m a rising junior majoring in Software Engineering at Western Governors University. This is my second degree, and Iâ€™m truly enjoying the opportunity to study a field Iâ€™m passionate about! Iâ€™ve always been passionate about web developmentâ€”an interest that began when my father introduced me to a few basic HTML tags. I spent hours experimenting with simple web pages, and that early exposure sparked a lasting passion for software development. During the pandemic, I made the most of my time by diving into HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and eventually the MERN stack. I went on to complete several professional certificate programs in back-end and full-stack development, which further reinforced my interest in the field and inspired me to pursue a BS in Computer Science.
