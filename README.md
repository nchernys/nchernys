### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Natalia, and I am a Full Stack web developer.   
  
I have always been passionate about web development. I remember the first time my father showed me some basic HTML tags when I was in high school and how I spent hours coding my first web pages. My passion for coding did not end there. During the pandemic, I decided to use the time I got free from commuting to work and social activities to learn coding. After taking several self-paced coding courses on Udemy and Coursera, I completed certificate programs in Back End with Python and Full-Stack Development (Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, University of Texas McCombs Business School Bootcamp) to advance my coding skills. I am currently taking CS courses on Sophia Learning to transfer credits to WGU and obtain my BS in Computer Science. I am passionate about brainstorming solutions for coding tasks and working on coding projects!
