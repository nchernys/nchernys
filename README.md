### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Natalia, and I am a Full Stack web developer.   
  
I have always been passionate about web development. I remember the first time my father showed me some basic HTML tags when I was in high school and how I spend hours coding my first web pages. My passion for coding did not end there. During the pandemic, I decided to use the time I got free from commuting to work and social activities to learn coding. After taking several self-paced coding courses on Udemy and Coursera, I enrolled in certificate programs in Back End with Python and Full-Stack Development (Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, University of Texas McCombs Business School Bootcamp) to advance my coding skills. I am passionate about brainstorming solutions for coding tasks and working on coding projects!     
  
I am currently working on a fragment for a Learning Management System using MERN stack and RESTful APIs. My project currently has student, course, assignment, and grade management systems using PUT, GET, PATCH, DELETE requests. You can check the works-in-progress of the back end code <a href="https://github.com/nchernys/school_dashboard_backend">here</a>. 
  
You can check my other projects in my <a href="https://github.com/nchernys?tab=repositories">repositories on GitHub</a> and on my portfolio website: <a href="https://portfolio.chernysn.tech">https://portfolio.chernysn.tech</a>.
