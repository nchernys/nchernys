### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Natalia, and I am a Full Stack web developer. I have always been passionate about web development. I remember the first time my father showed me some basic HTML tags and how I spent hours coding my first web pages. My passion for coding did not end there. During the pandemic, I decided to use my free time to learn coding. After teaching myself HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and finally the MERN stack, I completed several professional certificate programs in back end and full stack development, and I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science.
